# Sinapis AI Coach — Rubric (Concise, for Model Context)

> Purpose: Compact rubric the model reads before reviews. Keep under ~10k chars. Bullets only.

## 1) Problem
- Must-have pain; frequent/urgent; paid alternatives exist.
- Kenya/EA: seasonality (agri/school terms), power/connectivity, informal norms.
- Pitfalls: nice-to-have; founder bias; symptom vs root cause.

## 2) Value Proposition
- ≤3 sentences; outcome-focused; why better than status quo..
- Kenya/EA: mobile-first UX, M-Pesa/agent flows, offline/USSD, trust signals.

## 3) Unfair Advantage
- Hard-to-copy: IP, data, brand, network effects, privileged access.
- Evidence: MoUs/LOIs, exclusive rights, data pipelines, switching costs.
- Pitfalls: “first mover”; generic “great team”.

## 4) Customer Segments
- Evidence: segment size, ARPU, decision path, payment method.
- Kenya/EA: agent networks, SME vs micro, rural/urban split, diaspora remittances.

## 5) Channels
- Coverage from awareness→conversion→delivery→support.
- Kenya/EA: WhatsApp commerce, Jiji/Jumia, SACCOs/co-ops, field sales.

## 6) Customer Relationships
- Activation & onboarding, retention, expansion.
- Kenya/EA: cash collection cycle, languages, SLAs, agent incentives.

## 7) Key Activities
- Kenya/EA: last-mile logistics, import/clearance, uptime contingencies.

## 8) Key Resources
- Scarce assets: team, IP, data, physical, financing.
- Kenya/EA: talent costs, power backups, FX for imports.

## 9) Key Partners
- Fill capability gaps; reduce risk/cost; accelerate GTM.
- Kenya/EA: county permits, KEBS, aggregators, distributors, MNOs.

## 10) Revenue Streams
- Clear payer; pricing logic; margin path; diversification.
- Kenya/EA: mobile money fees, cash cycles, VAT/duties.

## 11) Cost Structure

- Kenya/EA: power/diesel, clearance fees, agent commissions.

## 12) Kingdom Impact
- Economic, Social, Spiritual, Environmental—embedded in ops.
- Pitfalls: impact as a statement, not a system; nothing supporting intentionality.

## Cross-Block Checks
- Value↔Segment, Segment↔Channels, Costs↔Revenue (seasonality/cash cycle), Activities/Resources↔Partners.

## Experiments (Riskiest Assumptions)


## Final Assessment Hints
- Quick Wins: 3–5 tactical actions (next 4–6 weeks).
- Deeper Questions: 5–7 board-level debates.
- Cohesiveness: short paragraph on narrative fit + biggest leap of faith.
