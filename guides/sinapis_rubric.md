# Sinapis AI Coach — Rubric (Concise, for Model Context)

> Purpose: Compact rubric the model reads before reviews. Keep under ~10k chars. Bullets only.

## 1) Problem
- Must-have pain; frequent/urgent; paid alternatives exist.
- Evidence: quotes, complaint rates, time/money lost, workaround spend.
- Kenya/EA: seasonality (agri/school terms), power/connectivity, informal norms.
- Pitfalls: nice-to-have; founder bias; symptom vs root cause.

## 2) Value Proposition
- ≤3 sentences; outcome-focused; why better than status quo.
- Evidence: before/after metrics, % time/cost saved, reliability gains.
- Kenya/EA: mobile-first UX, M-Pesa/agent flows, offline/USSD, trust signals.

## 3) Unfair Advantage
- Hard-to-copy: IP, data, brand, network effects, privileged access.
- Evidence: MoUs/LOIs, exclusive rights, data pipelines, switching costs.
- Pitfalls: “first mover”; generic “great team”.

## 4) Customer Segments
- Narrow ICP; reachable; willingness/ability to pay; payer vs user.
- Evidence: segment size, ARPU, decision path, payment method.
- Kenya/EA: agent networks, SME vs micro, rural/urban split, diaspora remittances.

## 5) Channels
- Coverage from awareness→conversion→delivery→support.
- Evidence: CAC by channel, funnel conversion, payback.
- Kenya/EA: WhatsApp commerce, Jiji/Jumia, SACCOs/co-ops, field sales.

## 6) Customer Relationships
- Activation & onboarding, retention, expansion.
- Evidence: churn/renewal %, cohort curves, NPS/CSAT.
- Kenya/EA: cash collection cycle, languages, SLAs, agent incentives.

## 7) Key Activities
- Few “factory” steps tied to value/channels/revenue.
- Evidence: process map, throughput constraints, QA/SLAs.
- Kenya/EA: last-mile logistics, import/clearance, uptime contingencies.

## 8) Key Resources
- Scarce assets: team, IP, data, physical, financing.
- Evidence: CVs, IP docs, data access, financing availability.
- Kenya/EA: talent costs, power backups, FX for imports.

## 9) Key Partners
- Fill capability gaps; reduce risk/cost; accelerate GTM.
- Evidence: contracts/SLAs, exclusivity, onboarding time.
- Kenya/EA: county permits, KEBS, aggregators, distributors, MNOs.

## 10) Revenue Streams
- Clear payer; pricing logic; margin path; diversification.
- Evidence: price tests, gross margin %, ARPU, elasticity.
- Kenya/EA: mobile money fees, cash cycles, VAT/duties.

## 11) Cost Structure
- Major drivers; fixed vs variable; unit costs; runway.
- Evidence: COGS bill, staffing plan, logistics/FX sensitivity.
- Kenya/EA: power/diesel, clearance fees, agent commissions.

## 12) Kingdom Impact
- Economic, Social, Spiritual, Environmental—embedded in ops.
- Evidence: hiring/purchasing policies, supplier due diligence, community metrics.
- Pitfalls: impact as a statement, not a system.

## Cross-Block Checks
- Value↔Segment, Segment↔Channels, Costs↔Revenue (seasonality/cash cycle), Activities/Resources↔Partners.
- Unit economics: Price, Gross margin %, CAC, Payback (months), Churn %, LTV.

## Experiments (Riskiest Assumptions)
- Smoke test, concierge/pilot, pricing, channel trial, churn interviews, service blueprint, instrumentation.

## Final Assessment Hints
- Quick Wins: 3–5 tactical actions (next 4–6 weeks).
- Deeper Questions: 5–7 board-level debates.
- Cohesiveness: short paragraph on narrative fit + biggest leap of faith.
